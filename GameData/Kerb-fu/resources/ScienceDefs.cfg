	RESULTS
	{
		default = X-ray diffraction data collection is complete.

		SunInSpaceHigh = This star eminates significant qualtities of high energy radiation
		SunInSpaceHigh = Looking away into the cosmos many radiation sources can be detected

		KerbinSrf = The readings seem ordinary 
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = There apears to be some high energy x-rays eminating from the kitchen area, very strange...
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = Several localised low level sources in this area...
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = The kitchen and latrines seem to be high emision areas.

		KerbinInSpaceLow = The planets mass seems to block a large amount of radiation
		KerbinInSpaceLow = Much higher quantities of soft x-rays seem to be visible outside the atmosphere.
		KerbinInSpace = High levels of radiation present in space would seem to indicate some form of sheilding will be required to prevent premature cooking of Kerbalsnacks. 

		MunInSpace = The surface seems to be reflecting X radiation, astounding!
		MunSrfLanded = The dust is getting into the instrument!

		MinmusInSpace = No significant surface sources can be measured.
		MinmusSrfLanded = Scanning the heavens reveals distant X-ray sources.

		GillyInSpace = Some odd readings present, may need recalibration.
		GillySrfLanded = Even the x-rays detected here appear small and lumpy...

		MohoInSpace = Measurable reflection of background radiation varies accross the surface.
		MohoSrfLanded = Measurable radiation here seems to lying around in tropical clothes with a cool drink and a tan, fascinating.

		EveInSpace = Even the X-rays here are purple!
		EveSrfLanded = Diffraction patterns on the scanner form the image of a bunch of grapes... purple grapes.

		DunaInSpace = The experiment data shows interesting diffraction data from reflected rays from both equator and polar caps.
		DunaSrfLanded = Scanning shows lower pressure atmosphere blocks less radiation.

		IkeInSpace = The surface reflection varies wildly
		IkeSrfLanded = Some of the surface appears to completely absorb even high energy X-rays

		DresInSpace = Some odd readings from the crators and canyon.
		DresSrfLanded = Surface scans seem to indicate unusual readings from deep in the crust.

		JoolInSpace = The planet itself appears to be a source of X radiation, how marvelous
		JoolSrfLanded = how did you even do this? land on a gas giant? amazing!...oh yes and readings seem to well off the chart...

		LaytheInSpace = Similarities to kerbins properties have been noted. However radiation levels seem higher.
		LaytheSrfLanded = Some strange readings show that further examination and experimentation is needed.

		VallInSpace = Some iregularities in readings, noted for future examination.
		VallSrfLanded = Minor seismic activity disrupts the reading, however enough data seems to have been recovered.

		TyloInSpace = The cratered side shows higher than background radiation levels.
		TyloSrfLanded = Radiation from multiple cosmic sources bombards the surface.

		BopInSpace = Mostly boring diffraction patterns...
		BopSrfLanded = Radiation scans seem to indicate that this moon is far older than anything else in the kerbol system...

		PolInSpace = Quite a nice diffraction reading, would look good hanging on the wall.
		PolSrfLanded = Scans show that background radiation levels are normal.

		EelooInSpace = Even the radiation detected here seems lonely.
		EeelooSrfLanded = The surface appears to quite reflective to x-rays, and no local sources seem to be present.
